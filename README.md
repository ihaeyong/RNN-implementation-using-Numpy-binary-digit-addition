# RNN-implementation-using-Numpy-binary-digit-addition
RNN implementation using only Numpy. Try to learn binary digit addition.
## [objective]
* Understand RNN with a simple numpy implementation.
* Train RNN for a binary opperation, e.g. addition.
* Check if the trained RNN can be extended to the unseen data with longer digits (e.g. 8 bytes digits training -> 10 bytes digit test)
## Problem (binary operation, especially addition)
